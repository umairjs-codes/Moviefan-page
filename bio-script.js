He was most famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald, the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon`s blood, and his work on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.    It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the rise of Lord Voldemort was formed, as it was he who founded and led both the first and second Order of the Phoenix. Due to the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997 and considered by many as the greatest Headmaster to ever grace Hogwarts. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, he planned his own death with Severus Snape.

His double life played an extremely important role in both of the Wizarding Wars against Voldemort. Severus started at Hogwarts with Lily in the 1971–1972 school year, where he was Sorted into Slytherin House. This put him in the same year as Lily but unfortunately for him she was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Severus became the immediate enemy of James Potter and Sirius Black and was a frequent victim of their bullying. As an active Death Eater, one of Snape`s biggest contributions was letting Lord Voldemort know about the prophecy Sybill Trelawney made to Dumbledore. This part of the prophecy could have applied to either Harry Potter or Neville Longbottom, who was also born at the end of July 1980 to parents who were members of the Order. Once Lord Voldemort decided to target the Potters over the Longbottoms, Snape begged Voldemort to at least spare Lily. Voldemort ostensibly agreed, but did not actually follow through on this promise due to Lily`s refusal to allow him to kill Harry, resulting in her sacrificing her life to save her son`s.',
